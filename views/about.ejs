        <h2>Hey there :)</h2>
        <p>People normally put cringey stuff here and no matter what I put, its gonna be cringe so welp :/</p>
        <p>I am currently a High School student living in the US. I have a wide array of interests and skills and this website outlines some of them.</p>
        <p>I gained an interest in tech at an early age by learning Java in my middle school's programming club.</p>
        <p>Since then - thanks to GitHub and other people in my life - my skills have extended to nodejs and linux (though I have dabbled in many other things as well).</p>
        <p><small>Disclaimer: I suck at css and this site isn't very mobile optimized but feel free to take a look</small></p>
